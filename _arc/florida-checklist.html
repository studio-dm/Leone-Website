					<h1>Florida Business Checklist</h1>
				  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					<div itemprop="text">
					  <p>The information in this   section is intended for prospective Florida business Buyers. There are   numerous laws and regulations required to legally own and operate a   business in the State of Florida. Unfortunately, it would be impossible   to prepare an exhaustive or comprehensive list of everything a business   buyer will need to do to prepare to assume the ownership and operation   of an existing business. Every business is different and has unique   requirements. A buyer of an existing Florida business should consult   their attorney and accountant and work closely with these professional   advisors, along with the seller of the business, in order to research   and properly prepare to assume legal ownership and operation of the   business. We hope this brief introduction prompts you to do the   necessary due diligence and research to become a successful owner of a   legally owned and operated business.</p>
					  <p>Once a Buyer is committed to closing on the sale of a business, there   is much to do. The list of tasks varies greatly depending the type,   size and complexity of the business, the Buyer&rsquo;s preferences and the   legal requirements to own and operate the specific business being   acquired. Although most Sellers are very helpful and obligated   contractually to assist in the transfer of the business, practically   speaking it is up to the Buyer to hire an accountant, seek legal advice   from an attorney and take all of the appropriate steps to make sure they   meet all of the legal requirements to own and operate the business at   the time they assume ownership.</p>
					  <p>Some of the items on a checklist that may need completed prior to buying an existing business may include:</p>
					  <ul>
					    <li><strong>Consult an Attorney</strong> to set up the appropriate legal   structure to own the business and reduce personal liability. The most   common legal structures for owning a Florida business are a Subchapter-S   Corporation or Limited Liability Company (LLC).</li>
					    <li><strong>Select a business trade name</strong> and determine if you   need to register the business name with a fictitious name filing. Owners   conducting business under a name other than their own may need to file,   even if the name seems very similar.</li>
					    <li><strong>Speak with an Accountant</strong> regarding the tax   implications of the legal structure and the allocation of the businesses   purchase price. The accountant can apply for an Employer ID Number   (EIN).</li>
					    <li><strong>Open a commercial bank account</strong> for your operating and/or payroll account(s)</li>
					    <li><strong>Decide if you will do in-house payroll</strong> or use a   payroll service or employee leasing service. Many of these services   offer complete human resources departments and all of the payroll tax   and unemployment tax required filings quarterly and annually</li>
					    <li><strong>Set up a credit card vendor/machine</strong></li>
					    <li><strong>Apply for Department of Revenue Sales Tax License</strong></li>
					    <li>Determine which licenses the business presently has and make sure they are current and valid at the time of sale.
					      <ul>
					        <li><strong>Local business registration</strong>: Obtain City, County   and/or Florida Business Tax Receipt applications and research the   process of how and when licenses can be obtained and whether or not the   licenses are transferable. Call city and county government offices to   see if they require a local business tax certificate (formerly an   occupational license) and/or zoning permit. For local business tax   certificates, check with the city clerk or county tax collector. Fees   vary by type of business and location. Many municipalities now make the   forms available online.</li>
					        <li><strong>State business registration and licensing</strong>: Pay   special attention to State Department of Business and Professional   Regulation (DBPR) Licenses, State Qualifier Licenses, County Specialty   Licenses, Liquor Licenses, etc. These licenses may have special   requirements that have to be met in when a business changes ownership.   Businesses found not operating with the proper licenses may receive   &ldquo;cease and desist&rdquo; orders and be fined, reprimanded or lose the right to   do the type of business the license allows.</li>
				          </ul>
				        </li>
					    <li><strong>Check into business liability and content insurance</strong>.   Start with the carrier being used by the Seller. Insurance is not   transferable in an asset sale. Make sure you have a binder prior to   closing. Research this well before closing. Insurance in Florida can be   difficult to obtain in flood zones or coastal zones considered to be   endangered by the threat of hurricanes. This also applies if you are   buying real property.</li>
					    <li>Work closely with the Seller to set up the<strong> transfer of all utilities</strong>, the phone, yellow pages, other advertising; etc.</li>
					    <li>Find out what <strong>contractual and/or business obligations and relationships</strong> the company has with customers, outside suppliers, vendors or services.   This could be anything from leased equipment, floor planning or other   product financing, redeemable gift cards, coupons or vouchers, vendor or   supplier credit applications for key vendors of the business,   distribution agreements, territory agreements, vendor purchasing   requirements or agreements, customer contracts or service agreements,   product or service warranty obligations, industry or local business   group memberships, etc.</li>
					    <li><strong>Florida Tangible Personal Property Tax</strong>. Florida   businesses that own tangible personal property (equipment, furniture,   computers, etc.) that is not included in the assessed value of the real   property must pay an annual tax. The tax is paid on form DR-405 to the   county property appraiser. The estimated tax for the current year should   be pro-rated at closing, with the Seller covering their pro-rata share   up to the date of closing.</li>
					    <li>The list can go on and on depending on the nature of the business you are buying.</li>
