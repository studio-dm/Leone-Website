Violet and I are writing this letter to express our gratitude for all of your efforts in our
business endeavor. Your knowledge and skills are what guided us in the right direction for
acquiring the right business for us, and we couldn&#39;t be happier.</p>
<p>I first came to you in late 2010, when I was looking to purchase a small restaurant
franchise. At that time, I knew that you represented the best in your office in regards to the
restaurant industry. I was confident in your knowledge and expertise, and I felt that you
would be of great assistance in finding a business that would be a good fit for me. I went
into our meeting thinking I knew what I wanted and what direction I wanted to go in. After
discussing my business background, and what to realistically expect when investing into a
restaurant, your explanation of how the &quot;industry‚Äù works, I was no longer sure of what I

wanted. You took that opportunity to point me in another direction; in which you assured me

would provide stability and possibilities I wasn&#39;t even aware of. As I am now the proud

owner of Comfort Solutions, you have far exceeded my expectations as a business broker.

This business venture has been a long road from beginning to end, and you have been

there to provide the reassurance I needed. Your patience and wisdom were extremely

helpful while dealing with an obstinate seller. The willingness you put forth to help me

through a difficult and lengthy SBA loan process is greatly appreciated. In the eight months

since I purchased this company, business is up over 30%, and I owe it to you.</p>

<p>Our entire family cannot thank you enough for your guidance, which has changed

our lives. If you ever are in need of a recommendation, please do not hesitate to contact

me, or have your clients contact me. I am looking forward to seeing you in the near future.<br><br>

Good luck to you-<br>

Sincerely,<br>

Tony &amp; Violet Leon</p></blockquote>

          <p><blockquote>To: Bob Leone<br><br>

<p>When we were in the market to purchase our restaurant, Bob Leone sold it to us. When

the unthinkable happened and tragedy struck, he stood by us and sold it for us.</p>

<p>Those two sentences don&#39;t tell the whole story - they can&#39;t. Mr. Leone is a dedicated,

honest salesman with a wealth of business knowledge, sales experience, integrity,

honesty and not a small amount of heart. He believes in the product he sells - otherwise

he wouldn&#39;t be half as good at what he does - but he also believes in the people behind

each transaction. He pays attention to his clients&#39; needs whether they&#39;re potential buyers

or hopeful sellers, frequently understanding his clients&#39; needs far better than they

themselves do.</p>

<p>Let me now explain what I mean by &quot;tragedy struck,&quot; and then explain why we are so

grateful.</p>

<p>The job market affected us as it affected so many other people, and since John had ample

restaurant management and operations experience he started looking for businesses in

that sector. His first plan was to start his own, but the economic situation at the time wasn&#39;t

conducive to small business loans regardless of experience and a good business plan.

So, he began to hunt for the perfect little restaurant with its established customer base. He

found such a restaurant being brokered by Mr. Leone.</p>

<p>About a month after his happy purchase, he became ill and sadly, within two months, he

passed away. My mother then found herself as the sole owner of a restaurant while also

happily employed in the public sector and without any time to dedicate to run a restaurant.

She understandably decided to sell, contacting Bob as soon as she felt able. She

explained the situation to Mr. Leone, who was more than happy to help. I ran the

restaurant while it was on the market, liaising with Bob when he needed information from

us or had an interested buyer seeking the grand tour.</p>

<p>It was a difficult time in our lives. Much to our surprise, the sale was absolutely not a

source of stress for us, and that&#39;s entirely due to the way Mr. Leone conducts his

business. He&#39;s personable, honest, and he only contacted us to keep us up to date or

request information. Not once did he make us feel pressured and, indeed, was more a

source of strength and reliability than anything else.</p></blockquote>
