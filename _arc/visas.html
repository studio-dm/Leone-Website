					<h1>E-2/E-1 &amp; L-1A Investor Visas</h1>	
					<p>We can assist you in locating a business that can qualify you to
 work and live in the US.  There are many ways to remain in the US 
legally when you want to own a business but the most popular ways are as
 an E investor/treaty trader or as an L-1A intra-company manager or 
executive.
</p>
<p>E-2 Treaty Investor</p>
<p>To qualify as an E-2 investor you must purchase an existing business 
or develop a new business. We can help you find the right business to 
qualify or space to develop your business. The US and your country of 
citizenship must have an E visa treaty. The investment should be around 
$100,000 and be able to support several workers, the number of workers 
will depend on the country you are from. Any type of business could 
qualify except real estate development companies can be problematic.</p>
<p>E-1 Treaty Trader</p>
<p>To qualify as an E-1 treaty trader, 50% of the trade or services 
between the US and your business outside the US must exist.  There must 
be a E-1 treaty between the US and your country of citizenship. There is
 no set investment amount required or certain amount of employees for 
this visa type.</p>
<p>The E visa process can be complicated but with the right team guiding you it’s a great way to own and run a business in the US.</p>
<p>L-1A Intra-company Manager/Executive</p>
<p>Sometimes there is no E visa treaty with the US, in that case an L-1A
 can be a great way to pursue your dream of owning a US business and 
living in the US. The L-1A visa requires that you have a foreign 
business that you have worked for either as a Manager/Executive for one 
of the last three years before applying for this visa. The US and 
foreign company must be owned by the same persons or entities in the 
same or similar proportions and both the US and foreign company must be 
actively doing business.</p>
<p>Permanent Residence aka Green Card</p>
<p>Both E and L visa categories could lead to permanent residence status
 aka a green card but you will need an immigration attorney to advise 
you on the best strategies to achieve your long-term goals.</p>
<p>EB-5 Investor Immigrant</p>
<p>A foreign buyer often wants to reside in the US long term but needs 
to invest either $500,000 or $1 million in a US business. How much they 
need to invest depends on where the business is located. A single 
investor in a US business is called a stand alone EB-5.</p>
<p>If the business is located in a Targeted Employment Area (“TEA”), an 
area determined by the state your business is in or the US Immigration 
Service to have a high unemployment rate or in a rural area then the 
amount of the investment could be $500,000 not $1 million. However, most
 EB-5 investors still need to create 10 full time positions at least 35 
hours a week despite where the business is located. There are a few 
exceptions to this rule such as the troubled business exception that the
 US business has to maintain the jobs at the business but it will only 
qualify for this if it meets certain financial requirements based on 
serious financial issues with the company.</p>
<p>Some foreign investors wish to invest in Regional Centers, where the 
investment they make is part of a larger project that benefits the US 
economy. Some investors prefer this because the 10 positions they need 
to create can include independent contractors but the stand alone EB-5 
investors can’t count independent contractors.</p>
<p>The first step in this process is buying the right business so that 
you can live and work in the US either short or long term. We are ready 
to help you begin this process and can also refer you to a qualified 
immigration attorney that works well with our team of brokers to help 
you apply for a visa in one of the categories above</p>
