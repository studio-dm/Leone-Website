					<h1>Financial Services</h1>	
					<p>Business acquisitions may be financed in a variety of ways. 
Buyer’s either pay all cash, becoming their own financier, seek Seller 
Financing or Third Party Financing through an SBA Loan, Conventional 
Commercial Loan, Home Equity Loan, Private Party Loan, Venture Capital, 
etc.  There are other sources who lend against assets or accounts 
receivable, (known as factoring) for specialized situations once you own
 the business.
</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at a few of these scenarios.</p>
<p>In a cash transaction the Buyer has no debt after the acquisition. 
This takes a lot of pressure of the new business owner. They may have 
structured the sale from an accounting standpoint to have loaned their 
Corporation the money, so the Corporation has to repay the individual 
the loan, but they are repaying themselves in a sense. This is a nice 
option. As long as you have left yourself appropriate working capital to
 run the business you can immediately start repaying yourself with the 
profits of the business, having no debt service or interest due to an 
outside source.</p>
<p>With seller financing the Seller typically has a first position lien 
on all the assets and inventory of the business. It show a lot of 
confidence in the business and the Buyer for the Seller to do this and 
generally these types of transactions require a substantial down 
payment, usually 1/2  or more of the overall purchase price. If the 
Buyer defaults the Seller with take back the business. Many Sellers are 
unwilling to do this as they do not how the Buyer will perform and they 
may be relocating or just not want to be in the position to have to take
 the business back. If the Seller will hold even a small amount of paper
 in a transaction, it is likely they will answer the phone when a Buyer 
has a question post closing. This is a big potential benefit. However 
the Seller usually likes to have a first position lien or some realistic
 collateral to do this. They don’t want to be in a secondary position 
with no collateral.</p>
<p>SBA financing can generally be done with between 20-25% down of the 
overall project cost. Project cost refers to the price of the business, 
loan closing costs, working capital etc. It is possible to put say 
$100,000 down on a $500,000 transaction and get $20,000 or more back at 
the closing table for working capital. Lack of working capital is one of
 the biggest reasons small businesses fail. They put every dime into the
 acquisition and may have immediate cash flow problems because of lack 
of cash flow from businesses that carry large accounts receivable or 
perhaps may be seasonal for example. Having working capital that at 
least matches the receivables is a minimum rule of thumb. (assuming your
 not buying the receivables in an asset sale) The Buyer may not start 
receiving A/R for 45 to 60 days after the acquisition, but meanwhile 
will be incurring payroll, cost of goods, operating expenses, etc.</p>
<p>SBA Loans put a first position lien on all the assets and inventory 
of the business, current and replacements. They also look for additional
 personal collateral, a second on your house, or a lien on other 
personal assets. Business assets can be here today and gone tomorrow and
 Lenders don’t give much credibility to the assets really securing their
 loan. Some Lenders won’t even do SBA loans unless the businesses real 
estate is involved. Then, in a worst case scenario, they have something 
to go after. These loans require excellent credit on behalf of the Buyer
 / Borrower and well documented cash flow on behalf of the Business / 
Seller.</p>
<p>It typically takes about $25,000 of cash flow or owner benefit to 
service every $100k of debt as a rule of thumb. Lenders look for a 1.2 
or 1.25 debt service coverage ratio. This means the businesses cash flow
 must cover the debt service and the Borrowers salary requirements 100% 
and then have a 20-25% safety margin of unutilized cash flow. Generally 
speaking, your 20-25% equity into an SBA loan is not supposed to be 
borrowed money, this hampers your debt service coverage ratio and the 
Lender must account for repayment of that loan as well, however many 
Buyers do take home equity loans out first and use the money as their 
equity into an SBA loan.</p>
<p>Conventional commercial loans from the commercial loan division of 
your favorite local bank are tough to get on a small business unless you
 can collaterize the loan with personal assets. These loans are 
generally much easier and faster, but are typically based on your 
personal net worth, banking relationships and willingness to pledge 
personal assets.</p>
